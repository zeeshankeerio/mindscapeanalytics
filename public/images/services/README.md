# Service Images

This directory contains images for the services page.

## Placeholder SVG

The `service-placeholder.svg` file is used as a fallback image when specific service images are unavailable. The services page code has been updated to automatically use this placeholder when:

1. The original image path doesn't exist
2. The original image has 0 bytes (empty file)
3. Any error occurs when loading the image
